# README

Built as a Rails 5 app, requirements are minimal beyond Rails, a DB, and a few javascript libraries.

Bundle install, create your DB, migrate, start the server and visit the homepage to get started.

http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/ is the original source for this project. Without his work and instructions, this wouldn't have been possible. I just wanted a way to save interesting maps and add a few details, as well as a bit of custom adjustments so I could show and hide labels, etc to see what is underneath a little better.
